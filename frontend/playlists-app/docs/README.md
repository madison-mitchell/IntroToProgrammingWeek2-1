# Urls and Stuff

Right now our Angular app is served from `http://localhost:4200`.
It obviously won't be that should it ever go into production.

Maybe something like `https://song-and-stuff.com`

Our API is at `http://localhost:3000/`. It will also not be that
in production.

Maybe something like `https://song-and-stuff.com/api/*`

Here `song-and-stuff.com` is the "Origin".

This will become important to us in a bit.
